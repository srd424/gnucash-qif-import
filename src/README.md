GnuCash QIF Import
------------------

[GnuCash][GnuCash] Python helper script to import transactions from [QIF][QIF] text files into GnuCash .gnucash file.

Main use case for myself was automating the import of QIF files generated by [GnuCash Mobile][GnuCash Mobile] Android app into my desktop GnuCash application.


Prerequisites
==============

* Python 2.7+
* GnuCash 2.4+
* GnuCash Python Bindings

Getting Started
===============

For Ubuntu 13.04:

    sudo apt-get install gnucash python-gnucash
    ./import.py -v -f examples/accounts.gnucash examples/expenses.qif

The above command should log two "Adding transaction for account.." lines and will add the expenses from examples/expenses.qif to the accounts.gnucash file.
Open accounts.gnucash with GnuCash before and after executing the above command line to see the difference.

The Python script will assume "EUR" as default currency (QIF files do not specify any currency). Use the "--currency" command line flag to change this.
